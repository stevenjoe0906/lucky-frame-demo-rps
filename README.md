### Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/)
3. `npm install`
4. `netlify dev`

... and deploying should just be as simple as [watching a git repo for commits](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/).

if you are running this on MAC, before pushing to netlify, go to node_modules/, delete the sharp/ directory and run this command!

npm install --platform=linux --arch=x64 sharp%
